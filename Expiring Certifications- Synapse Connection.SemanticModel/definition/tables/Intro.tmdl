			Pending Expiring Targets: Displays recently added curricula requirements for existing certifications that are not yet mandatory for certification. This sheet tracks status of incomplete remaining (new) requirements to help managers ensure they are completed before the Due Date, which will change the curricula (certification) status from Complete to Incomplete. Once these Due Date are reached, the curricula enrollment will no longer appear in this sheet and will not be distinguished from other Incomplete curricula (there is no longer an Expired status for technical certifications in the Learning Management System)"
